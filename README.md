# React Pokemon Store ðŸ’»

## Description ðŸ“š
 This project is a simple Pokemon store built with React, where users can browse and buy their favorite Pokemons. 

## Features:
1. Shopping cart state management
2. Integration with PokeApi
3. Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

## 1. Shopping cart state management
I used the React useContext hook to manage the state of the shopping cart feature for the Pokemon store. By using useContext, the cart state is global, and the cart's contents can be accessed and modified from anywhere in the app. Additionally, the cart state is saved in the local storage, so that the user's cart persists across sessions.

##  2. Integration with PokeApi
To display information about each Pokemon in the app, I integrated the external PokeApi. The app fetches details like name, image, and stats for each Pokemon from the API.

## 3. Responsive design with Tailwind CSS
To quickly and easily style the app, I chose to use the Tailwind CSS utility framework. With Tailwind CSS, responsive design is simple, as the framework provides pre-defined classes that can be added to HTML elements. This saved me a lot of time and allowed me to complete the project in around 4 hours.

## Motivation
The creation of this app was driven by my desire to showcase my expertise in several key areas of web development. Specifically, I wanted to demonstrate my ability to handle external API calls, manage global state using React, and create a user interface that meets the needs and expectations of the end-users. By creating this app, I aimed to showcase my skills in integrating with external APIs, specifically the PokeApi, to retrieve and display data in a meaningful way. Additionally, I wanted to demonstrate my proficiency in using React to manage the global state of the app, in this case, the shopping cart feature. Lastly, I wanted to prove that I have the ability to create a responsive, user-friendly interface that meets the needs and expectations of the target audience.
